High priority
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- SRM 2.2 test scenarios and testing
- Testing, optimize for speed, code cleanup (headers, parsing macros?)

Normal priority
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- BREAK and CONTINUE in loops
- ECHO (vs. SYSTEM echo --- performance considerations)
- Support more $TAGs, e.g.:
  * $STR2HEX{}, $HEX2STR{}, $STR2BIN{}, $BIN2STR{}, ...
  * $FILE{<eval> <file>} (read in contents from <file> and optionally <eval>uate tags it contains)
- SEND/RECEIVE (TCP/UDP/RTP,RTCP,SIP,...)?

Low priority
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Plugin architecture to make addition of new protocols less intrusive?
- Port to BSDs?
- Both NPTL and LinuxThreads leak a bit (although somewhat differently according to valgrind);
  investigate?  Use Apache threads instead?
- Investigate gSoap memory leaks yet again???
