Release 2.0
This tarball provides a set of scripts that all take as argument the host name
of the SRM v2.2 endpoint. The scripts exit with a return code of 0 if 
the check went OK or >0 if an error occured. In this last case, an explanation
is printed out.
The scripts require that the environmental variable LCG_GFAL_INFOSYS is set 
to point to the BDII to be used by the scripts.
