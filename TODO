Ordered by priority
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- SRM2 test scenarios and testing (storage system info/description as testing)!
- Implement SRM 2.2
- sed 's/^n_srm//'
- Testing, optimize for speed
- output of TEST ${empty} == "" and simillar in e* files
- ECHO (vs. SYSTEM echo --- performance considerations)
- Support more $TAGs, e.g.:
  * $FILE{<eval> <file>} (read in contents from <file> and optionally <eval>uate tags it contains)
  * $STR2HEX{}, $HEX2STR{}, $STR2BIN{}, $BIN2STR{}, ...
- Plugin architecture to make adding of new protocols simple?
  API change to call return &soap and leave deallocation up to the client: soap_end(&soap)?
- SEND/RECEIVE (TCP/UDP/...)?
- Both NPTL and LinuxThreads leak a bit (although somewhat differently according to valgridn);
  investigate?  Use Apache threads instead?
- Investigate gSoap memory leaks???  Spent ages trying to figure out how to
  get rid of them...
