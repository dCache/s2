Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First of all, it is recommended that you install the
vdt_globus_essentials package if you are planning to use
globus-url-copy command to do the actual file transfers, and that
your /etc/grid-security/certificates contains valid certificates
(ca_* packages).


Binary distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are two versions of the binary RPM distribution.  The first <RPM>
gridpp-s2-<VERSION>.rpm is a GridPP-specific package which depends
on the vdt_globus_essentials package.  The other <RPM> is called
s2-<VERSION>.rpm and depends only on the standard system libraries.
Both of these packages were compiled on Scientific Linux 3.0.5.

The <RPM>s is installed by 
# rpm -ivh <RPM>

If RPM is not your preferred type of a binary package, you can either
convert it into a gzipped tar-ball
# alien -t <RPM>

or you can convert it into a CPIO archive and unpack the files by
# rpm2cpio <RPM> > <RPM>.cpio
# cpio -id --verbose < <RPM>.cpio


Source distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
S2 is not easy to compile.  If you feel adventurous, you'll need:

* gSOAP 2.7.2 (precisely this version) 
  http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/soap.html
  e.g.:
  http://heanet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/gsoap2/gsoap_2.7.2.tar.gz
* CGSI_gSOAP_2.7 plugin (I used CGSI_gSOAP_2.7-1.1.9)
  http://cern.ch/castor/DIST/CERN/savannah/CGSI_gSOAP.pkg
* PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) library >= 4.4
  http://www.pcre.org/
* diagnose library >= 0.3.8 (optional in principal, but 
  strongly recommended)
  http://storage.esc.rl.ac.uk/apt/datastore/sl/RPMS.stable/
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/libdiagnose

$ ./configure --help
$ ./configure [your_options] && make
$ make install [prefix=your_prefix]
$ make rpm

Note that if you just want to play with the S2 language and do not
want SRM2 support, use
$ ./configure --disable-gsoap


Testing directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A simple test framework was created in the testing directory.
The framework generates all kinds of diagnostics files, therefore
it is recommended to copy/move it to a directory when users have
read-write permissions.
