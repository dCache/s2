Please send bug reports with S2 scripts causing them to the current

Known problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1 NPTL bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~
I'm experiencing a deadlock in 1 out of 10000 consecutive runs of a
script spawning parallel processes using nested parallel repeat loops
with NPTL 3.2.5.  The same test was fine for 1000000+ consecutive runs
with the traditional LinuxThreads 0.10 library (the test took one
week to complete).  Please use "getconf GNU_LIBPTHREAD_VERSION" to
see which threads library you're using before reporting deadlocks.
You do not need to report them for NPTL 3.2.5.

Expected problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Parallel execution, timeouts and expression evaluation
  didn't receive as much testing as they deserve and are still being
  tested.  Please report problems!

2 Memory leaks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2.1 LinuxThreads and NPTL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
valgrind reports minor, constant memory leak for both libraries

2.2 gSoap
