- Support more $TAGs (e.g.: $STR2HEX{}, $HEX2STR{}, $STR2BIN{}, $BIN2STR{}, ...)
- Plugin architecture to make adding of new protocols simple?
  API change to call return &soap and leave deallocation up to the client: soap_end(&soap)?
- SEND/RECEIVE (TCP/UDP/...)?
- Both NPTL and LinuxThreads leak a bit (although somewhat differently according to valgridn);
  investigate?  Use Apache threads instead?
- Investigate gSoap memory leaks???
