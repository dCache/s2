%  This file exists because the first node in the tree (or subtree) is
%  parsed differently.  It MUST NOT have any ';;', '||' or '&&' at the
%  beginning.
%
%  Since we do not necessarilly know the order in which 'include'
%  files are processed, we always include this file as a work-around.
%  This should ensure that the first node in the tree is always the
%  no-op operation: NOP
%
% There is an tacid assumption here: that any '#include' preprocessing
% directive is the first item of the tree (i.e., appear first
% non-empty, non-comment in the test file) or exist as the first item
% in a sub-tree.
