Known bugs:
~~~~~~~~~~~
1) Parallel execution didn't receive as much testing as it
   deserves.  You don't need to report bugs, the parallel execution model
   will be redesigned and code rewritten.
2) Timeouts are disabled, they don't work well with parallel execution.

You don't need to report bugs for the above two points as the parallel
execution model will be redesigned and code rewritten.
