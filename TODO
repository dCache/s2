Ordered by priority
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- SRM 2.2 test scenarios and testing
- Testing, optimize for speed (e1, e2 evaluation only if required)
- code cleanup (parsing macros?)
- output of TEST ${empty} == "" and simillar in e* files
- ECHO (vs. SYSTEM echo --- performance considerations)
- Support more $TAGs, e.g.:
  * $FILE{<eval> <file>} (read in contents from <file> and optionally <eval>uate tags it contains)
  * $STR2HEX{}, $HEX2STR{}, $STR2BIN{}, $BIN2STR{}, ...
- SEND/RECEIVE (TCP/UDP/...)?
- Plugin architecture to make addition of new protocols simple?
- Both NPTL and LinuxThreads leak a bit (although somewhat differently according to valgridn);
  investigate?  Use Apache threads instead?
- Investigate gSoap memory leaks yet again???
