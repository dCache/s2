Ordered by priority
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Nicer way logging of strings
- $RAND{} and similar that cause problems + flag to evaluate only "static" variables?
- TEST $EXPR vs just TEST
- MATCH => $MATCH{"a" "b"}
- LT/GT/... (<, >, ...)
- SRM2 test scenarios and testing (storage system info/description as testing)!
- WHILE loop
- $EXIST/DEFINED{[::]<var>}
- Saving to global vars (?P<::Hello>.*)
- ECHO (vs. SYSTEM echo --- performance considerations)
- Consider using '' for expressions which will not be evaluated (q_param).
- Investigate gSoap memory leaks.
  API change to call return &soap and leave deallocation up to the client: soap_end(&soap)?
- SEND/RECEIVE (TCP/UDP/...)?
- minor (possible) pthreads POSIX threads related memory leaks (consider using Apache threads).
