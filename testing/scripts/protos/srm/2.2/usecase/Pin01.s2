% Pin01: Put a file, then get it to make sure it has a TURL.
% Then increase the pin lifetime using the request token _and_ the SURL, which must not work.
%
% put cycle:
%   srmPrepareToPut
%   srmStatusOfPutRequest
%   srmPutDone
% srmExtendFileLifeTime
%
% From the notes on the behaviour of: srmExtendFileLifeTime
% This method allows to change only one lifetime at a time (either SURL lifetime by the newFileLifetime or pin
% lifetime by the newPinLifetime), depending on the presence or absence of the request token. SURL lifetimes are
% on SURLs that resulted from the successful srmCopy or srmPrepareToPut followed by srmPutDone, and pin
% lifetimes are on TURLs or file copies that resulted from srmPrepareToGet, srmPrepareToPut or srmBringOnline.
