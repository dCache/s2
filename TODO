Ordered by priority
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Expression evaluation testing (64-bit integers):
  * error reporting (passing error from non-terminal to non-terminal)
  * location of errors in expressions
- SRM2 test scenarios and testing (storage system info/description as testing)!
- Investigate gSoap memory leaks.
  API change to call return &soap and leave deallocation up to the client: soap_end(&soap)?
- Refactor parallel execution model and timeouts ("process notion")
- $RANDOM, ...
- ECHO (vs. SYSTEM echo --- performance considerations)
- SEND/RECEIVE (TCP/UDP/...)?
- More preprocessor directives (#define) or functions?
- minor POSIX threads related memory leaks (consider using Apache threads).
