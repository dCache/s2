Q: The script just hangs.
A: The easiest thing to do is to run the script with a timeout
option.  If you're running a series of tests by "make test", you
can say "S2_TIMEOUT=<usec> make test" instead, where <usec> is the
timeout value in microseconds.  You could also investigate which
branch "hangs" based on the debugging/logging information provided.
If this doesn't help, you may have found a bug.  Please see BUGS.
Note that timeouts are quite expensive, don't use them if you don't
need to.
