This directory contains some basic examples of using SRM 2.2
functionality.  The aims is establish, whether a given method
was implemented or not.

Note that the tests are alpha, under construction, far from being
complete, correct, ready...

The procedure make_result_web_page.sh can be used to generate summary web
pages from the tests executed on multiple SRM implementations.

In particular, in the file testing/scripts/protos/srm/s2.env in the
case statement you can find all possible values that refer to the various
endpoints for the SRM implementations available at the moment.

a) In order to allow the make procedure to execute on different endpoints
creating output subdirectories for each endpoint, you need to modify
the content of the shell script:
testing/scripts/protos/srm/env.[c]sh
to point to the right endpoint.

b) Then you need to source the script.

c) Then sitting in the directory testing/scripts/protos/srm/2.2/basic
you need to execute the following commands:
make -e test

You can repeat steps a) to c) for each endpoint that you like.

In order to create the web page summary report, execute the command:
./make_result_web_page.sh
