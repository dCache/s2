Known problems
==============
1 Memory leaks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.1 gSoap
~~~~~~~~~
Linear memory leaks.  Spent at least half a day trying to get rid of
them, I'm clueless.

1.2 LinuxThreads and NPTL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
valgrind reports very minor, constant memory leak for both libraries
(only "possible" memory leak for NPTL).


Expected problems
=================
1 SRM 2.2 implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Written in a hurry and received little testing.  Please expect and
report problems.

2 Parallel execution, timeouts and expression evaluation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tested quite a bit, but not as much as I'd like.  Please report
problems.
