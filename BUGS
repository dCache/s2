Please send bug reports with S2 scripts causing them to the current
maintainer.  When reporting BUGs, please verify against the latest
s2 version.

Known problems
==============
1 NPTL bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~
I'm experiencing a deadlock in 1 out of 10000 consecutive runs of a
script spawning parallel processes using nested parallel repeat loops
with NPTL 3.2.5.  The same test was fine for 1000000+ consecutive runs
with the traditional LinuxThreads 0.10 library (the test took one
week to complete).  Please use "getconf GNU_LIBPTHREAD_VERSION" to
see which threads library you're using before reporting deadlocks.
You do not need to report them for NPTL 3.2.5.

2 Memory leaks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2.1 LinuxThreads and NPTL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
valgrind reports very minor, constant memory leak for both libraries

2.2 gSoap
~~~~~~~~~
Quite severe linear memory leaks.  Spent at least half a day trying
to get rid of them, I'm clueless.

Expected problems
=================
1) SRM 2.2 implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Written in a hurry therefore please expect and report problems.

2) Parallel execution, timeouts and expression evaluation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tested, but not as much as I'd like.  Please report problems!
