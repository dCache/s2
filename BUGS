Please send bug reports with S2 scripts causing them to the current
maintainer.  When reporting BUGs, please verify against the latest
s2 version.

Known problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) NPTL bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~~
I'm experiencing a deadlock in 1 out of 10000 consecutive runs of a
script spawning parallel processes using nested parallel repeat loops
with NPTL 3.2.5.  The same test was fine for 100000 consecutiveruns
with the traditional LinuxThreads 0.10 library.  Please use
"getconf GNU_LIBPTHREAD_VERSION" to see which threads library you're
using before reporting deadlocks.  You do not need to report them
for NPTL 3.2.5.

Expected problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Parallel execution, timeouts and expression evaluation
  didn't receive as much testing as they deserve and are still being
  tested.  Please report problems!
