This directory contains templates for the SRM2 <ACTION>s for the
s2 language.  Its aim is to provide syntax for the SRM2 <ACTION>s
until the grammar for these actions is created and the s2.txt document
updated.

Please look at the `../basic' and `../usecase' directories first
which contain some real examples.
